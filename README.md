SECTION 1:
----------

WARNING:
When Liz and I firstly started to work on this we had no previous programming experience. If you have a CS background you might find many redundancies and structural errors, please feel free to change them!

THE PHILOSOPHY:
During last year developing something quickly was the most important thing to achive, for this reason we built the app using as a framework Django and hosting the website on Heroku for a quick hosting. If you have never used Django please follow the tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/ . The Django version used here is 1.5.4
